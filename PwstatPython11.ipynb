    "Q1 Who developed  python programmming langauage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, and it was first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum started working on Python in the late 1980s, and its design philosophy emphasized code readability and simplicity, which has contributed to its popularity among programmers. Python is an open-source programming language, and its development is guided by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the Python community."

    "\n",
    "- Procedural Programming: Python supports procedural programming, where a program is structured as a sequence of instructions that operate on data.\n",

    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python is an object-oriented programming language, allowing developers to define classes and create objects with attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts, such as higher-order functions, lambda functions, and the use of map, filter, and reduce functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imperative Programming: Python supports imperative programming, where programs are composed of statements that change a program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Declarative Programming: While not purely declarative, Python allows for declarative programming styles, such as with list comprehensions and generator expressions, which focus on what should be computed rather than how.\n",

    "Q14 How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Memory management in Python is primarily handled by the Python memory manager, which is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for objects dynamically. Here's an overview of how memory management works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object Allocation: When you create objects in Python (e.g., variables, lists, dictionaries, etc.), the Python interpreter dynamically allocates memory to store those objects in the heap. Each object contains both the data it represents and additional information, such as a reference count and type information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference Counting: Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of how many references (pointers) exist to each object. Every time you assign an object to a variable, pass it as an argument to a function, or store it in a data structure, the reference count of the object is incremented. When a reference to an object is removed (e.g., when a variable goes out of scope or is reassigned), the reference count is decremented. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, meaning there are no more references to it, the object is eligible for garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python employs a garbage collector to reclaim memory occupied by objects with zero reference counts. The garbage collector periodically scans the heap to identify and deallocate unreachable objects. Python's garbage collector uses a combination of strategies, including reference counting, cyclic garbage detection, and generation-based garbage collection (in Python 3), to manage memory efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Management Optimization: Python's memory manager includes various optimizations to improve memory usage and performance, such as object reuse, memory pooling, and optimization of small object allocation. These optimizations help reduce memory fragmentation and overhead, leading to more efficient memory utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Profiling and Tuning: Python provides tools and libraries for memory profiling and tuning, such as the tracemalloc module and third-party packages like memory_profiler. These tools allow developers to analyze memory usage, identify memory leaks, and optimize memory-intensive code for better performance and resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Overall, memory management in Python is automatic and transparent to the developer, thanks to the Python memory manager and garbage collector. However, understanding memory management principles and best practices can help developers write more efficient and scalable Python code."
