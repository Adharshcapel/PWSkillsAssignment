    "    In Python, a tuple is an ordered, immutable sequence of elements. This means that once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some characteristics of tuples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tuples are defined using parentheses () or the tuple() function\n",
    "    Elements in a tuple are separated by commas\n",
    "    Tuples can contain elements of different types, including other tuples\n",
    "    Tuples can be accessed using indexing or slicing, just like lists\n",
    "    Tuples are often used to group related data together, such as a name and age or latitude and longitude coordinates\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Because tuples are immutable, they are useful in situations where you want to ensure that the contents of the sequence cannot be changed accidentally. For example, you might use a tuple to represent a set of configuration values that should not be altered while the program is running.\n"

    "Q2. What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why\n",
    "tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, tuples have two built-in methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "count(): This method takes a single argument and returns the number of times that argument appears in the tuple. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "index(): This method takes a single argument and returns the index of the first occurrence of that argument in the tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why tuples have only two built-in methods as compared to lists is because tuples are immutable, meaning that they cannot be modified once they are created. Lists, on the other hand, are mutable and have many built-in methods that allow for adding, removing, and modifying elements. Since tuples cannot be modified, they do not need as many built-in methods as lists. The count() and index() methods are typically all that is needed to work with tuples.\n",
